Good morning, Victor. How are your tonsils feeling today? Yeah, good. I woke up, I was feeling a bit sick. I had a bit of a temperature and I'm like a pretty sore throat, but I don't know what condition I have. Okay. How long have you been feeling this way? I just woke up this morning feeling a bit sick. I was feeling a bit tired the last couple of days. Yeah. Okay. I can see that you have a rash on your hand. When did that present? Yeah, that was last couple of weeks. I think it's not to do with my condition. Okay. Well, in that case... Do you think that I have chlamydia? I don't think you have chlamydia. Okay. But I think it's possible that you may have... Glandular fever. Glandular fever.
